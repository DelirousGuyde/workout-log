## General Progression Philosophy

1. **RPE-based autoregulation**: Target RPE 8-9 on top sets, 7.5-8 on back-offs
2. **Add weight when**:
   - Hit top of rep range
   - RPE is at or below target
   - Form is clean
3. **Hold weight when**:
   - RPE is already at ceiling (9+)
   - Form is breaking down
   - Recovery is compromised
4. **Deload when**:
   - Weights feel heavy for 2+ weeks
   - Accumulated fatigue/aches
   - Every 6-8 weeks proactively

## Recovery Considerations

- **Sleep**: Prioritize 7+ hours
- **Non-negotiable**: 1.5-2 hour daily workout window
- **Work constraints**: 2-3 productive hours/day, training fits around childcare
- **Joint preservation**: Don't max every set, leave 1-2 reps in tank on back-offs
